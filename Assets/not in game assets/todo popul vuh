ugh... finishing a goal exactly as the level ends doesn't make it show up in the shop as completed. tooltip also needs to disappear

make a way to display credits

dragging hand should subtract the position of the card you selected so it stops dragging if you only move it over a bit

when you buy cards, canvas $ doesn't update

regression: cards don't reorder when you play them (?) or they don't reorder when you get hit by the little mole guy that makes you discard (?) or they don't reorder when you draw a new card mid turn (this is definitely true)

make customize menu dragging not shitty as hell

set useGUILayout = false; on almost everything

deck shrinks when low on cards and disappears when out of cards

reimplement sick squares




/// New ui
click on the player: info about the player
click on an enemy: info about the enemy

click on a card with targetsquares: unselect it


Need an animation controller for the main character:
    - makes a queue of animations when you play a card, and when done it calls
      whatever the "card finished playing" method is on Card

/// new sprites!
P1
weapon attacks: 
    - pike
    - macana
    - bow (?) + arrow
    - magic ball
        - explosions on squares that are affected
    - need to add in extra time for stuff that takes longer than normal to animate
eating / drinking animations
non-eating / drinking action animations
death explosion for main character and enemies
    
P2
visible armor:
    - shield
    - shirt
    - redo main character sprite to not look shitty and to also fit these armors
    - display armor and discard it when you get hit
    - have a funny state when you have 5 shields or whatever    
    
enemy emotions:
    - attacking
    - getting hit
