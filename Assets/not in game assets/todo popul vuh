Regressions

New features
    make a way to display credits
    reimplement sick squares, maybe have a nagual wizard that makes them
    Create a "this has never happened before" dialog for the first time that you:
        - finish a level and get cards
        - get hit with each of the 3 types of sickness
        It should have a unique message and dialog box option ("Got it!", "Oh no!")
        Should save to your save file
    tutorial arrows
    info mode should be like .2s or .15s
    apple guidelines for stuff

Bugs
    when you buy cards, canvas $ doesn't update
    playing a targetsquares card doesn't activate the Q
    ugh... finishing a goal exactly as the level ends doesn't make it show up in the shop as completed. tooltip also needs to disappear
    there seems to be a subtle bug in clickcontrol layering where you are trying to drag your hand but it drags the board
    when you select a card, the enemy keeps flashing, that's bad i guess

New sprites / animations
    /// new sprites!
    P1
    Need an animation controller for the main character:
        - makes a queue of animations when you play a card, and when done it calls
        whatever the "card finished playing" method is on Card
    weapon attacks: 
        - pike
        - macana
        - bow (?) + arrow
        - magic ball
            - explosions on squares that are affected
        - need to add in extra time for stuff that takes longer than normal to animate
    eating / drinking animations
    non-eating / drinking action animations
    death explosion for main character and enemies
        
    P2
    visible armor:
        - shield
        - shirt
        - redo main character sprite to not look shitty and to also fit these armors
        - display armor and discard it when you get hit
        - have a funny state when you have 5 shields or whatever
    enemy emotions:
        - attacking
        - getting hit
